Dataset
The dataset used for this project is [mention your dataset source or upload the file]. It includes historical sales data, advertisement spends, market conditions, and other relevant features.

The data is stored in the data/ folder.

Sample Data Structure:
Date	Product	Region	Ad Spend	Sales
2023-01-01	A	North	1000	5000
2023-01-02	B	South	2000	6000
Modeling Approach
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature encoding, and scaling.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features based on the existing data.
Model Training: Various regression models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests were trained and evaluated.
Model Evaluation: Models are evaluated based on Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared metrics.
Usage
To train the model:

bash
Copy code
python src/model_training.py
To evaluate the model:

bash
Copy code
python src/model_evaluation.py
Results
The best model achieved an R-squared value of 0.85 and a Mean Squared Error of 2000 on the test set.

Model 1 (Linear Regression): R² = 0.70
Model 2 (Random Forest): R² = 0.85
Model 3 (XGBoost): R² = 0.88
Future Improvements
Implementing hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV/RandomizedSearchCV).
Adding more features like seasonality or external market conditions.
Explore deep learning approaches such as neural networks.
